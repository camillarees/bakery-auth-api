## Overview
The goal of this auth-api project is to implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) using an Access Control List (ACL), allowing to not only restrict access to routes for valid users, but also based on the individual permissions we give each user.

## How it Works

## Key Features
Restrictive Capabilities of our routes to our API:
- Customers can READ only on savory and sweet menus
- Wait Staff can READ and UPDATE on savory and sweet menus
- Head Chefs can READ, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE
- Managers can READ, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE

## Architecture

- Sequelize
- Express
